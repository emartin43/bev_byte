## Bev's Byte 1 -- Electricity Demand from Ember

### My goal for this project:
The goal of this project is to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) on monthly electricity demand (TWh) data from Ember. Demand is calculated as the sum of power production and net imports. Ember provides data for 215 countries from 2000 to 2020, and where possible have gathered 2021 and 2022 data using national sources. Currently, energy prices have been the focus of global news, especially in Europe. Since Iâ€™m currently based out of Spain, I thought I would look at electricity demand, which is a component of energy prices. I initally found the data set on Data is Plural, a weekly newsletter that provides unique data sets from around the Internet. 

### What I learned from this project:
Because I had never worked with maps in ggplot or RStudio before, it was an entirely new experience to create the above gif of electricity demand. Loops are notoriously difficult for me to think through, but after referring back to my Intro to Computer Science notes and some online resources, the loop for the spatiotemporal map is some of my proudest looping work. 

### If I had more time I would change:
In the future, I would do some searching for a similar dataset with energy prices instead of electricity demand. To me, although energy demand is a component of prices, it would be a more nuanced exploration of the dataset to see how the different prices for the same amount of energy compare globally. I also would have made a more easily acessible paged table for electricity demand by country so that all of the data observations would have been easily accessible.

## Bev's Byte 2 -- Sentiment Analysis of "Into the Wild"

### My goal for this project:
My motivation for this project was two-fold. Firstly, I am a big fan of Jon Krakauer, and one of my favorite books of his is "Into the Wild". Secondly, I wanted to try something creating something with R that I had never done before. This project, therefore, is the marriage of my personal and professional interests. I had read an article touting how cool it can be to run a sentiment analysis on different types of media, and because sentinment analysis is something that I was new to before this project, I decided to give it a go in this rendition of Bev's Byte. I initially thought to analyze the script of the "Into the Wild" movie, but I thought that the book would have more dialogue and vocabularly to work with than the movie. I found a pdf of the book through the Internet and converted it to a text file.
